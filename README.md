This is the final test for my graduation: The project is developed in AngularCLI. I spent little time on the graphic design, focusing on the management to work.
When logged in, the server shows you the company client list, invoices list and the users list. You can also sign up as a new user: you will be shown in the users list.
Don't try to peek the company data without logging in: my guards won't let you!
